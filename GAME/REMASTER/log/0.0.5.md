# Dev Log v0.0.5 - UI Overhaul & Viewport Implementation

## Summary
This update focuses on implementing the complete "Dashboard" user interface, integrating the Phaser map into a central viewport, and aligning the visual style with the original project's aesthetics.

## Key Changes

### 1. UI Architecture
- **Grid Layout:** Implemented a 12x12 grid system using Tailwind CSS to structure the interface.
- **Panel Components:** Created modular React components for:
    - `StatusPanel`: Survival stats (HP, Hunger, etc.)
    - `InventoryPanel`: Item list and weight.
    - `CommandPanel`: Keyboard shortcuts.
    - `InfoPanel`: World info (Time, Location, Weather).
    - `EquipmentPanel`: Equipped items slots.
    - `StatsPanel`: Character attributes.
    - `MoralCompass`: Alignment slider.
    - `LogPanel`: Narrative text log.
- **Viewport System:** The central column of the grid is now transparent, while side panels are opaque (`bg-black`). This creates a "viewport" effect where the game map (rendered by Phaser in the background) is only visible in the center of the screen.

### 2. Visual Style (Modern Retro)
- **CRT Effects:** Implemented `CRTOverlay` component adding:
    - Scanlines
    - Vignette
    - Screen Glow
- **Color System:** Updated the base green color to `#4ade80` (Tailwind green-400) to match the original "The Safe Place" React project's standard theme.
- **Typography:** Used monospaced fonts with text shadows to simulate terminal displays.

### 3. Technical Improvements
- **Tailwind CSS v4:** Successfully configured Tailwind CSS with PostCSS for the Remaster project.
- **Phaser Integration:** Refined the z-indexing strategy to ensure the Phaser canvas sits correctly behind the UI layer but remains visible through the viewport.

## Next Steps
- Implement actual data binding for the UI panels (connecting to Zustand stores).
- Refine the "Color System" to support multiple themes (Standard, CRT, High Contrast) as in the original game.
- Implement the Inventory logic and interaction.
