# v2.0.1 - Layout Stabilization & Hotfixes

**Date:** 2025-12-03
**Status:** Stable

## Changes
This release addresses critical visual regressions introduced during the refactoring process.

### 🔧 Fixes
- **Tailwind CSS Downgrade**: Reverted from Tailwind CSS v4 to **v3.4.1**. The v4 release caused widespread layout breakage due to changes in how base styles and defaults are handled.
- **Layout Restoration**: Fixed `body` and `#root` height issues in `index.css` (`height: 100vh`), restoring the visibility of the game map and correct panel sizing.
- **Asset Recovery**: Restored missing `assets/` directory and fixed broken import paths in `SaveLoadScreen` and `MainMenuScreen`.

### 🏗️ Technical State
- **Hybrid Rendering**: The game currently runs on the new React 19 + Vite stack.
- **Phaser Integration**: Phaser 3 is initialized (`PhaserGame.ts`) and ready, but the map rendering temporarily relies on the legacy `CanvasMap` component to ensure playability while the full Phaser scene migration is prepared.

## Known Issues
- None. The game is fully playable and visually identical to v1.9.9.9.
